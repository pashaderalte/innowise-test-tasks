## **Task 5**

Given two integers A and B. Write a function that outputs all numbers from A to B inclusive, in ascending order if A < B, or in descending order otherwise. Use recursion.

Func args: (integer A, integer B).

**For example**

*Input:* 4, 9

*Output:* 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

*Input:* 9, 4

*Output:* 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4

**What would success look like?**

A function that outputs all digits from A to B in the order given by the condition

**Questions**: 
- What are the advantages and disadvantages of recursion?
  - Advantages: 
    - Easy to write
    - Solve naturally recursive problems like finding the factorial, Fibonacci number and tree traversal
  - Disadvantages:
    - High use of memory that cause the slowing down of app run
    - Difficult to analyze someone else's code
