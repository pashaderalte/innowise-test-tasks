## **Task 3**

Write a PHP function to add the digits by absolute of an integer repeatedly until the result has a single digit.

**For example**

*Input:* 5689

*Output:* 1

*Explanation:* 5689 = 5+6+8+9 = 28 = 2+8 = 10 = 1+0 = 1

**What would success look like?**

A function that works with numbers, returning an array of solved values.

**Questions**: 
- What methods are available for working with arrays?
  - pop(), push(), array_reduce(), array_sum(), array_map(), array_filter() and others from https://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.array.php
