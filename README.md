## **Task 8**

Create a class "Matrix". The class must have the following variables:

- a two-dimensional array of real numbers;
- the number of rows and columns in the matrix.

The class must have the following methods:

- addition with another matrix;
- multiplication by a number;
- print output;
- matrix multiplication. *

**What would success look like?**

A class that implements the necessary methods.

**Questions**: 
- What are magical methods? How can they be used in practice?
  -  __construct(), __destruct(), __call(), __callStatic(), __get(), __set(), __isset(), __unset(), __sleep(), __wakeup(), __serialize(), __unserialize(), __toString(), __invoke(), __set_state(), __clone(), and __debugInfo().
  - That are special methods helps us to overload operators or just prevent some unexpected behavior with object of class, generally they are used for prevent of accessing of non-existent methods or properties.
